Basic Encryption Tools

A beginner‑friendly yet powerful collection of classic encryption
algorithms implemented in Python. This project includes an interactive
command‑line menu that lets users encrypt and decrypt text using four
different ciphers. Perfect for learning cryptography fundamentals,
practising Python, and showcasing clean, modular code on GitHub.

1\. Caesar Cipher A simple shift cipher that rotates letters by a fixed
amount. 2. XOR Cipher A byte‑wise encryption method using a numeric key
(0--255). Commonly used in low‑level security and obfuscation. 3.
Vigenère Cipher A polyalphabetic substitution cipher using a text-based
key. 4. Atbash Cipher A monoalphabetic cipher that reverses the alphabet
(A ↔ Z, B ↔ Y, etc.).
